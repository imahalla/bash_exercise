This repository contains four Bash scripts that I created while practicing on [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). These scripts cover various topics and functionalities, showcasing my understanding of Bash scripting.

- [Script 4: Fortune Teller](#script-4-fortune-teller)

## Script 1: Questionnaire

This script prompts the user with three questions: their name, location, and favorite coding website. It then displays a personalized message with the user's responses.


## Script 2: Countdown Timer
This script takes a positive integer as an argument and counts down from that number to zero, displaying each number with a one-second delay.

## Script 3: Bingo Number Generator
This script generates a random number between 1 and 75 and displays the corresponding Bingo letter and number combination (e.g., B:14, I:28, N:42, G:53, O:72).

## Script 4: Fortune Teller
This script prompts the user to ask a yes or no question and provides a random fortune or response from a predefined list of responses.
These scripts were created as part of my learning journey on FreeCodeCamp.org and demonstrate my understanding of Bash scripting concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and user input/output.

Feel free to explore the scripts, modify them, ect.
